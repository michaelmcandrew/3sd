The utility module is a module that contains a bunch of utilities that are simple to code, everyone wants, but nobody actually codes them.

Right now, we have the following utilities:
* System module fieldset closer
* Allow to enable/disable individual plugins' through admin/settings/util page
* Automatically save height for resized textarea
* and more


To create new utilities for your drupal site place your code in a .inc file and into util/utilities/[YOUR UTILITY]/ folder
