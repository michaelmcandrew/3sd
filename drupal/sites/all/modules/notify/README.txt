REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

This module requires a supported version of Drupal and cron to be 
running.

------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------

1. Extract the notify module directory, including all its subdirectories, into
   your sites/all/modules directory.

2. Enable the notify module on the Administer >> Site building >> Modules page.
   The database tables will be created automagically for you at this point.

3. Modify permissions on the Administer >> Users >> Permissions page.

4. Go to Administer >> Content >> Notification settings and modify the settings
   to your liking.
   Note: e-mail updates can only happen as frequently as the cron is setup to.
   Check your cron settings.

5. To enable your notification preferences, click on the "My notification
   settings" on the "My account" page. Or, similarly go to another user's
   account page at user/<user_id_here> to modify his or her personal settings.

6. Additional options can be set at Administer >> User management >> Users by
   clicking the "Notification settings" tab.
